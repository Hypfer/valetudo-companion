# Valetudo Companion (Android)

This app listens for Bonjour broadcasts of recent (2021.07.0++) Valetudo instances on your network
and will display each one in a list to make it easy to access them without needing to set up
static DHCP leases or looking into your routers webinterface.

In the future, this might also be used to streamline the provisioning process of a robot with Valetudo installed.

Note that this app is completely optional and only exists to make Valetudo more accessible.


This app will not provide any UI to interface with Valetudo during normal operation.
Basically, you can think of it as an automatically updating bookmark + some wizard stuff.
